Replication Data for: Conceptions of National Identity and Ambivalence towards Immigration ,doi:10.7910/DVN/A48JP7,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/A48JP7,"National identities are often conceived of as factors that lend structure and stability to citizens’ political opinions on issues such as immigration: While citizens who define national membership in ethno-cultural terms are less likely to support immigration, those with a civic conception are more likely to do so. We propose that defining national identity along both ethno-cultural and civic lines may give rise to conflicting considerations leading people to experience ambivalence, implying that national identities may serve less as a stabilising force than suggested by previous research. Findings from heterogeneous choice models and a unique survey experiment show that German citizens with mixed conceptions of national identity had more variable and more malleable opinions than individuals with ideal-type conceptions during the 2015/2016 European refugee crisis. Our findings point to an identity-based source of ambivalence and extend our knowledge of how people form attitudes towards immigration.",2019-03-04T10:53:38Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Lindstam, Emmy; Mader, Matthias ; Schoen, Harald",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0
Replication data for: The strategic nature of compliance: An empirical evaluation of law implementation in the central monitoring system of the EU,doi:10.7910/DVN/FREK34,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FREK34,"This compliance study models correct and timely implementation of policies in a multi-level system as a strategic game between a central monitoring agency and multiple implementers, and evaluates statistically the empirical implications of this model. We test whether compliance is determined by the anticipated enforcement decision of the monitoring agency, and whether this agency is responsive to the probability of enforcement success and the potential sanctioning costs produced by non-complying implementers. Compared to other monitoring systems, the centralized monitoring system of the EU is praised for exemplary effectiveness. Our findings, however, reveal that the monitoring agency refrains from enforcing compliance when the probability of success is low and the sanctioning costs are high. Our strategic model indicates a compliance deficit, even though the selective enforcement activities of the monitoring agency are almost always successful before court.",2015-03-31T00:00:00Z,Harvard Dataverse,"König, Thomas; Mäder, Lars",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0
"Pre-Analysis Plan for a Survey Experiment on Committees, Voting Rules and Voters' Beliefs",doi:10.7910/DVN/1DMAAJ,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/1DMAAJ,"Many institutional environments share two common features: Decisions are made by a group of representatives (a committee) and decision-making takes place by secret ballot. Yet, even a secret ballot does not guarantee complete anonymity. As long as the observer has information about the committee’s joined decision and the employed voting rule, some information about representatives’ vote choices is leaked. Probability theory and Bayes’ Theorem in particular suggest that the amount of learning that is possible is a function of the voting rule, the size of the committee and the observer’s prior belief about representatives’ vote choices. Using a survey experiment we evaluate if voters are Bayesian learners and update prior beliefs about representatives' behavior in a committee using knowledge about the committee's joined decision. The experiment is implemented in the German Internet Panel wave 24 (July 2016).",2016-07-12T18:19:52Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Marbach, Moritz; Swalve, Tilko",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Replication Data for: The Wisdom of Crowds Design for Sensitive Survey Questions,doi:10.7910/DVN/KHIMOS,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KHIMOS,"Survey research on sensitive questions is challenging because respondents often answer untruthfully or completely refuse to answer. Existing indirect questioning techniques address the problem of social desirability bias at the expense of decreasing estimates' efficiency. We suggest the Wisdom of Crowds survey design that does not pose a tradeoff between anonymity and efficiency as an alternative. We outline the conditions necessary for the technique to work and test them empirically. Moreover, we compare the Wisdom of Crowd estimate of a right-wing populist party's vote share to alternative indirect questioning techniques' estimates as well as to the official election result in the 2017 German federal election. Provided its conditions are met, the Wisdom of Crowds design performs best in terms of both bias and efficiency. We conclude that the Wisdom of Crowds design is an important addition to social scientists' survey methodology toolbox.",2020-03-30T13:43:48Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Lehrer, Roni; Juhl, Sebastian; Gschwend, Thomas",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0
Replication Data for: The Sensitivity of Spatial Regression Models to Network Misspecification,doi:10.7910/DVN/NAJIKB,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NAJIKB,"Spatial econometric models become increasingly popular in various subfields of political science. However, the necessity to specify the underlying network of dependencies, denoted W, prior to estimation is a prevalent source of criticism since the true dependence structure is rarely known and theories mostly provide insufficient guidance. The present study investigates the effects of this network uncertainty which is a special case of model uncertainty that arises from uncertainty about the correct specification of W. It advocates Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as a superior approach to this problem, located at the intersection of theory and empirics. Conducting Monte Carlo experiments, I demonstrate that, while the effect estimates are robust towards a misspecification in the functional form of W, uncertainty in the neighborhood definition can bias the effect estimates derived from spatial autoregressive models. In contrast to alternative techniques, BMA directly addresses network uncertainty, correctly identifies the true network structure in the set of feasible alternatives, and provides unbiased effect estimates. Two replication studies from different subfields of the discipline illustrate the benefits of this approach for applied research.",2019-01-13T18:15:07Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Juhl, Sebastian",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Replication Data for: Measurement Uncertainty in Spatial Models: A Bayesian Dynamic Measurement Model,doi:10.7910/DVN/ICTG9Z,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ICTG9Z,"According to spatial models of political competition, parties strategically adjust their ideological positions to movements made by rival parties. Spatial econometric models have been proposed to empirically model such interdependencies and to closely convert theoretical expectations into statistical models. Yet, these models often ignore that the parties' ideological positions are latent variables and, as such, accompanied by a quantifiable amount of uncertainty. As a result, the implausible assumption of perfectly measured covariates impedes a proper evaluation of theoretical propositions. In order to bridge this gap between theory and empirics, the present work combines a spatial econometric model and a Bayesian dynamic item response model. The proposed model accurately accounts for measurement uncertainty and simultaneously estimates the parties' ideological positions and their spatial interdependencies. To verify the model's utility, I apply it to recorded votes from the sixteen German state legislatures in the period from 1988 to 2016. While exhibiting a notable degree of ideological mobility, the results indicate only moderate spatial dependencies among parties of the same party family. More importantly, the analysis illustrates how measurement uncertainty can lead to substantively different results which stresses the importance of appropriately incorporating theoretical expectations into statistical models.",2018-06-06T14:48:16Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Juhl, Sebastian",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Replication Data for: The legislative consequences of internal conflict and inter-party divisions,doi:10.7910/DVN/PFQWRM,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PFQWRM,"Governments must respond quickly to pressing economic and societal problems. However, institutional rules, public opinion and unanticipated world events often delay the legislative process. Building on theories of legislative decisionmaking and intra-party politics, this paper shows that the speed at which bills pass is also driven by the governing party’s internal cohesiveness and its ideological distance to the opposition. Governing parties that are internally divided have greater difficulty in forming the legislative majorities necessary to pass laws quickly, especially if their preferences are further away from the opposition. I test these hypotheses using a novel collection of laws passed in the UK Parliament and conference speeches given by Labour and Conservative party members over a 10-year period. I use automated text classification techniques to determine the relative location of actors’ preferences and the level of intra-party disagreement. I then predict the duration of lawmaking based on the government’s recent internal level of conflict and its distance to the opposition. The results complement mounting evidence that parties’ internal policy divisions hold important implications for parties’ performance in government.",2015-05-25T19:26:47Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Haber, Matthias",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

In this article, we address the broader question as to how patterns of conflict within parliament effect legislative activity of governments and parliamentary actors. Through a simultaneous analysis of the success and event history of over 12,000 legislative bills in three parliamentary systems and one semi-presidential system from 1986 until 2003, we show how the interplay of actor motivations and institutional settings has a discriminating impact on the potential of both the government and parliament to induce policy change.",2015-05-30T19:35:53Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Bräuninger, Thomas; Debus, Marc; Wüst, Fabian",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

We estimate latent positions and exploit bridge ob- servations to make the scales comparable. We also incorporate expert survey data as prior information in the estimation process to avoid ex post facto in- terpretation of the latent space. To illustrate the empirical contribution of our method we estimate the left-right positions of more than 388 European parties competing in 238 elections across 25 countries and over 60 years. Compared to the puzzling volatility of existing estimates, we find that parties more mod- estly change their left-right positions over time. We also show that estimates without country- and time-specific bias parameters risk serious, systematic bias in about two thirds of our data.

Even more so, when one term – like cross-validation – can mean very different things. We find different meanings of cross-validation in applied political science work. In the context of predictive modeling, cross-validation can be used to obtain an estimate of true error or as a procedure for model tuning. Using a single cross-validation procedure to obtain an estimate of the true error and for model tuning at the same time leads to serious misreporting of performance measures. We demonstrate the severe consequences of this problem with a series of experiments. We also observe this problematic usage of cross-validation in applied research. We look at Muchlinski et al. (2016) on the prediction of civil war onsets to illustrate how the problematic cross-validation can affect applied work.

While scholars have shown that coalition parties rely on legislative amendments to police deviations from the coalition compromise, there are notable gaps in our understanding of legislative review, most importantly, regarding the substance of amendments. Introducing the concepts constructive and destructive legislative review, we identify distinct patterns of legislative review by government and opposition parties. Based on the notion of collective cabinet responsibility, we argue that coalition parties are bound by informal rules that limit them to the labor-intensive redrafting of bills (constructive review). Conversely, opposition parties take a low-cost approach by proposing to strike out bill sections (destructive review). We provide empirical support for our hypotheses by analyzing an original dataset of counterfactual bills from a German state legislature.

Replication Data for: Precarious work and challenger parties: how precarity influenced vote choice in the 2018 Italian election,doi:10.7910/DVN/YFGXQ3,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YFGXQ3,"Across Western European democracies, the last 20 years have seen a growth of precarious employment and the rise of challenger parties. Both trends are especially marked in Italy, where occupational insecurity has become the norm and over half of the electorate has turned to a challenger party. In this article, I investigate the relationship between these two phenomena, addressing the question of whether and how precarity in the labor market influenced vote choice in the 2018 general election. First, I provide descriptive evidence that the Italian labor market shifted from dualism to generalized precarization. Second, I empirically investigate the relationship between precarity and voting in this context. The results show that the perception of precarity, not formal employment status, influenced voting behavior: it fostered participation, increased support for the Five Star Movement, and decreased support for the Democratic Party. These findings challenge core assumptions in the literature, first and foremost about precarious workers’ low turnout rate, difficult mobilization and consequent political irrelevance. They indicate that the electoral weight of precarious workers has increased, and their representation can be electorally beneficial.",2023-10-05T09:27:36Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Girardi, Elisabetta",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0
"Replication Data for: Sometimes Less Is More: Censorship, News Falsification, and Disapproval in 1989 East Germany",doi:10.7910/DVN/AZFHYN,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/AZFHYN,"Does more media censorship imply more regime stability? We argue that censorship may cause mass disapproval for censoring regimes. In particular, we expect that censorship backfires when citizens can falsify media content through alternative sources of information. We empirically test our theoretical argument in an autocratic regime---the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Results demonstrate how exposed state censorship on the country's emigration crisis fueled outrage in the weeks before the 1989 revolution. Combining original weekly approval surveys on GDR state television and daily content data of West German news programs with a quasi-experimental research design, we show that recipients disapproved of censorship if they were able to detect misinformation through conflicting reports on Western television. Our findings have important implications for the study of censoring systems in contemporary autocracies, external democracy promotion, and campaigns aimed at undermining trust in traditional journalism.",2019-11-25T14:28:48Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Gläßel, Christian; Paula, Katrin",N/A

Replication Data for: The potential of online sampling for studying political activists around the world and across time,doi:10.7910/DVN/346Y30,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/346Y30,"Parties and social movements play an important role in many theories of political science. Yet, the study of intra-party politics remains underdeveloped as random samples are difficult to conduct among political activists. This paper proposes a novel procedure to sample different parties over time and space by utilizing the advertising option of the social media webpage Facebook. As this method allows for quotas and the collection of large samples at relatively low cost, it becomes possible to improve the representativeness through post-stratification and subsample robustness checks. Three examples illustrate these advantages of Facebook sampling: First, a Facebook sample approximates intra-party decisions and the outcome of a leadership contest of the Alternative for Germany. Second, a weighted Facebook sample achieves similar estimates as a representative local leader survey of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Third, by evaluating subgroups of key demographics for parties with unknown population parameters, two Facebook samples show that the color-coded conflict in Thailand is driven by different concepts of regime type, but not by a left-right divide on economic policy-making. Facebook sampling appears to be the best and cheapest method to conduct time-series cross-sectional studies for political activists.",2017-02-15T22:33:43Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Jäger, Kai",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Abstract: Parliamentary debates are an important stage in the process of designing new policies and play an important role for discussing the policy reactions to exogenous events like the Covid-19 pandemic or long-term developments like climate change. We combine theories on vote-seeking strategies of political actors with theoretical accounts that highlight the impact of personal characteristics of politicians and argue that in particular younger Members of Parliament (MPs) should put more emphasis on issues related to climate change and its consequences than older MPs. We test our hypotheses on the basis of an original dataset covering all parliamentary debates that focus on issues related to climate change in the German Bundestag from 2013 until 2021, thus concentrating on a time period when climate change became a highly salient issue among the German public. We find that the age of MPs matters: the younger MPs are, the more speeches they contribute to parliamentary debates related to climate policy.",2022-07-04T20:59:23Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Debus, Marc; Himmelrath, Noam",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Relying on a conjoint experiment implemented in a probability-based survey of the German population, our study unveils the distinct causal effect of different forms of party unity on vote choice. We further establish that appearing united can compensate for substantive policy distances between parties and voters.

 Age Structure and Political Violence: A Re-Assessment of the ‘Youth Bulge’ Hypothesis,doi:10.7910/DVN/2LY2WB,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/2LY2WB,"A popular hypothesis in international studies states that a ‘youth bulge’ – an age pyramid dominated by large cohorts between 15 and 29 years of age – increases the risk of political violence. However, empirical evidence on this link remains inconclusive to date. In this article, we systematically assess the youth effect using new data from 183 countries between 1996 and 2015. We find that within countries, a decrease in the youth ratio is generally associated with a decrease in the number of violent deaths from terrorism or other internal conflicts, and vice versa. This is also confirmed in out-of-sample predictions. However, the association is not evident in all constellations and sensitive to modeling issues. In particular, large cohorts of young males can become a disruptive power in countries that increase enrollment in post-primary education. Although this is usually followed by fertility decline, youth bulges often remain at record levels for quite some time due to high birth rates in the past. Strong labor markets can in general suppress the detrimental consequences of youth bulges. However, the combination of growing youth cohorts and educational expansion often leads to increased political violence even in the presence of low youth unemployment.",2018-09-15T19:48:08Z,Harvard Dataverse,Hannes Weber,http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0
Trial fairness before impact: Tracing the link between post-conflict trials and peace stability,doi:10.7910/DVN/YY7XBX,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YY7XBX,"In this study, I investigate the impact of post-conflict trials on peace stability in post-conflict countries. I contend that empirical effects of post-conflict trials are contingent upon the partiality of the proceedings. While impartial trials promote accountability and confidence in the rule of law, partisan trials marginalize opposition forces and provide selective amnesties for government allies. To create comparable insights on partiality levels of post-conflict trials, I conduct an expert survey evaluating all major post-conflict trials between 1946 and 2005 (53 trials in total). The findings reveal that most trials were partisan while few represented genuine instances of accountability-seeking. Building on these insights, a quantitative analysis disentangles the impacts of partisan and impartial trials on peace stability using a global sample of post-conflict episodes (N=265). The results demonstrate that positive effects of post-conflict trials on peace stability are primarily driven by partisan trials. Hence, the correlation between post-conflict trials and peace stability is mainly a product of power consolidation operating through coercive victor’s justice. While impartial post-conflict trials likewise tend to stabilize peace, their incidence is too small to trace a generalizable effect in a quantitative analysis. In light of these findings, this study calls for restraint when making consequentialist arguments about choices of post-conflict justice instruments.",2019-12-18T15:38:14Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Steinert, Christoph",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Not only are amendment proposals by the opposition often unsuccessful (lack of policy motivation), they are largely invisible to the electorate (lack of vote motivation).

Yet, even if comparative scholars find similar treatment and comparison units, the interpretation of the post-treatment trajectory is difficult as short-term estimates can be subject to strategic timing of reform implementation, while long-term effects are likely affected by further interventions. To illustrate these difficulties we apply the generalized synthetic control method to evaluate the introduction of a British national minimum wage. We find a short-term decreasing effect on youth unemployment that turns into an increasing effect over time. This suggests the presence of an upward biased selection effect from strategic timing. We also inspect two post-treatment interventions and find that they differ in their general and country-specific implications for the long-term trajectory.",2019-05-21T17:57:51Z,Harvard Dataverse,"König, Thomas; Ropers, Guido; Buchmann, Anika",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Replication Data for: The Wald Test of Common Factors in Spatial Model Specification Search Strategies,doi:10.7910/DVN/CY7YWE,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CY7YWE,"Distinguishing substantively meaningful spillover effects from correlated residuals is of great importance in cross-sectional studies. Both forms of spatial dependence not only hold different implications for the choice of an unbiased estimator but also for the validity of inferences. To guide model specification, different empirical strategies involve the estimation of an unrestricted spatial Durbin model and subsequently use the Wald test to scrutinize the non-linear restriction of common factors implied by pure error dependence. However, the Wald test's sensitivity to algebraically equivalent formulations of the null hypothesis receives scant attention in the context of cross-sectional analyses. This article shows analytically that the non-invariance of the Wald test to such reparameterizations stems from the application of a Taylor series expansion to approximate the restriction's sampling distribution. While asymptotically valid, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that alternative formulations of the common factor restriction frequently produce conflicting conclusions in finite samples. An empirical example illustrates the substantive implications of this problem.

The Problem of Equivalence in Comparative Research,doi:10.7910/DVN/TMWJYL,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TMWJYL,"Researchers in comparative research are increasingly relying on individual level data to test theories involving unobservable constructs like attitudes and preferences. Estimation is carried out using large-scale cross-national survey data providing responses from individuals living in widely varying contexts. This strategy rests on the assumption of equivalence, i.e. that no systematic distortion in response behavior of individuals from different countries exists. However this assumption is frequently violated with rather grave consequences for comparability and interpretation. I present a Multilevel Mixture Ordinal Item Response Model with Item-bias Effects that is able to establish equivalence. It corrects for systematic measurement error induced by unobserved country heterogeneity and it allows for the simultaneous estimation of structural parameters of interest.",2011-06-24T00:00:00Z,Harvard Dataverse,Daniel Stegmueller,http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Empty Promises and Nonincorporation in Mercosur,doi:10.7910/DVN/4MTMXW,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/4MTMXW,"Why do the member states of the world’s fourth-largest trading block incorporate only about two-thirds of all policies they adopt? This article argues that empty promises are an important reason for Mercosur’s incorporation problems and that Mercosur’s institutional design furthers such a defective behavior. Member governments easily sign agreements whenever they are rewarded for the mere act of doing so. However, if they expect high costs from implementing these policies, they try to avoid incorporation. Since only the last state to incorporate a policy triggers its overall legal validity, Mercosur’s members can easily veto any agreement ex post. In addition to empty promises, mismanaged drafting and incorporation and the abuse of negotiation power also pose important obstacles to incorporation. Free riding, however, does not play a role. Due to the incorporation rules, there can be no externalities that incentivize unilateral defection. The article substantiates the arguments empirically with the multivariate analysis of the complete incorporation record of 1,033 policies adopted between 1994 and 2008.",2018-03-01T14:58:54Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Arnold, Christian",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Will the Euro and the fiscal mechanism of the Eurozone survive? And how about the effectiveness of this Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) - do the Euro countries generally fail to comply with the rules of fiscal governance, or, does the Eurozone need a more member-specific fiscal mechanism? In this article, we examine whether and how the SGP influenced the development of governmental debt-making in the Euro countries after the introduction of the Euro. While the SGP could not prevent Euro countries from exceeding their deficits, our synthetic control-analysis reveals that the mechanism effectively reduced overall governmental debt of Euro countries since 1999. In particular donor countries were able to control governmental spending, while many recipient countries -ÃÂÃÂ including Greece, Portugal and Italy -ÃÂÃÂ increased governmental debt ever since, resulting in the European sovereign debt crisis. This suggests that while the SGP effectively constrained overall governmental debt-making, a more sophisticated mechanism is required for safeguarding compliance in large recipient countries.",2014-11-04T00:00:00Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Koehler, Sebastian; Koenig, Thomas",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Instead, for each court decision, we use the positions of political actors expressed in written statements as well as the courts' decision outcome to estimate comparable policy positions. In two applications, we position the German Federal Constitutional Court with different German governments and the European Court of Justice with different European governments in common policy spaces and validate them.

This implausible finding has raised questions about the efficacy not only of RILE for estimating left-right positions but of coded party manifestos for political science research in general. The recently developed Manifesto Common Space Scores (MCSS), which reduce leapfrogging by accounting for the election-specific character of party manifestos, provide alternative estimates for parties’ left/right-positions, but little is known about their validity. This study shows that MCSS estimates exhibit greater convergent validity relative to RILE estimates when compared to other measures of parties’ left/right-positions. It also finds that MCSS has greater construct validity relative to RILE estimates in two prominent cases (Greece and Italy). Overall, the findings underscore the election-specific character of party manifestos and demonstrate that MCSS is a useful alternative measure of parties' left-right positions.",2017-04-12T17:08:00Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Flentje, Jan-Erik; König, Thomas; Marbach, Moritz",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0
Unpacking the effects of burdensome state actions on citizens’ policy perceptions,doi:10.7910/DVN/Q2WLFS,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Q2WLFS,"Administrative burdens appear to influence citizens’ perceptions of welfare policies and attitudes toward beneficiaries. However, empirical evidence that has disentangled different state actions’ effects on policy perceptions is scarce. We applied a 2x2x2 factorial survey experiment and manipulated the conceptually distinct state actions implemented in German unemployment benefits. We investigated whether and how exposure to learning demands, compliance demands, and sanctions affected citizens’ prejudices against beneficiaries, policy support, and perceived legitimacy. The results from a sample of 1,602 German citizens indicate that those confronted with program sanctions exhibit less policy support and expect higher policy spending. Similarly, sanctions decreased the Federal Employment Agency’s perceived legitimacy. These results have implications for administrative burden and policy feedback research. Distinguishing different state actions provides nuances to assess policy feedback effects. Practitioners should consider whether program sanctions are necessary because they evoke unintended policy feedback effects.",2023-10-17T23:03:30Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Sievert, Martin; Bruder, Jonas",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Contemporary trade agreements, however, often reach beyond trade in the narrow sense. Consequently, factors unrelated to free trade may affect citizens’ evaluations of these agreements. We propose a model of attitude formation toward specific trade agreements that includes the societal context as a constitutive feature. We expect salient aspects of an agreement to activate corresponding predispositions. Empirically, we compare how this contextual model and a standard model perform in explaining German citizens’ attitudes toward free trade and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The results show that the standard model performs well in explaining public opinion on the principle of free trade but is less useful to explain attitudes toward TTIP. The latter were driven by postures toward transatlantic cooperation, predispositions toward the role of interest groups in politics, and market regulation—aspects salient in German public discourse about TTIP. In sum, we find ample evidence for the need to differentiate between the two attitude objects and for our contextual model of attitude formation.

We show that the majority of journalists are killed in democracies and present an argument that focuses on institutional differences between democratic states. In democracies, journalists will most likely be targeted by local state authorities that have limited options to generally restrict press freedom. Where local governments are elected, negative reporting could mean that local politicians lose power and influence, especially if they are involved in corrupt practices. Analyzing new global data on journalist killings that identify the perpetrator and visibility of the journalist, we show that local-level elections carry an inherent risk, particularly for less visible journalists. Killings perpetrated by criminal groups follow a similar pattern to those by state authorities, pointing to possible connections between these groups.

We argue that the clarity of the expressed policy position may be equally important. If blurred messages towards different audiences and therefore ambiguous positions can attract votes from different groups, parties have incentives to present ambiguous rather than clear-cut policy platforms. We present a formal model of multiparty competition with stochastic voting where party leaders make strategic choices on both the position and the level of ambiguity of their platforms. Leaders respond to the demands of two principals, the general public and party core constituencies. We derive two hypothesis on the location and ambiguity of party platforms and provide initial tests of these hypotheses in a comparative setting in 14 Western European democracies gathering data on voter and party left-right positions from Eurobarometer surveys and electoral manifestos. Ambiguity of party profiles is estimated using a variant of Wordscores on a newly established dataset of electoral manifestos. We find that platforms become more ambiguous as the preferences of the two principals diverge.

However, expanding the economy can also increase environmental pollution. If citizens value clean air and water, worsening pollution has the potential to galvanize large segments of the society against the regime---which increases the risk of a revolution. While the literature has documented how concerns over the environment upend politics in democracies, we know relatively little about the effects of these concerns in authoritarian regimes. We analyze environmental pollution as an overlooked threat to authoritarian rulers. Using unique data from Communist East Germany and exploiting variation in thermal inversions to instrument for pollution levels, we find that pollution causes both individual and collective expressions of regime dissatisfaction.

Although research provides evidence for transnational emulation of parties' position-taking strategies, these findings do not directly apply to saliency strategies. Moreover, the exact diffusion mechanism remains largely elusive. Based on the issue saliency literature, we develop novel theoretical propositions and argue that conscious learning enables parties to infer the relative utility of emphasizing consensual issues during an electoral campaign. Our theory gives rise to different expectations at the domestic and the transnational level because of the distinct logic of issue competition. By analyzing environmental issue emphasis in party manifestos, we find direct transnational dependencies and indirect spillover effects among the parties' saliency strategies. We further identify conscious learning rather than mere imitation or independent decision-making as the diffusion mechanism at work. Yet, in line with saliency-based theories, electoral competition mutes the diffusion of electoral strategies domestically.",2021-02-08T08:50:58Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Juhl, Sebastian; Williams, Laron K.",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

We argue that the effect of group appeals crucially depends on respondents’ group affect and the valence of the group appeal. Among those with a positive attitude towards a group, adding a positive group appeal to a policy statement should increase support for the policy statement, while adding a negative appeal (i.e., against the group) should decrease support. Among those with negative attitudes towards a group, the opposite effects should occur. We test our expectations with two survey experiments. Our results indicate that the addition of group appeals substantially influences the evaluations of voters and leads to higher polarization. Social group appeals are useful to political parties, but these rhetorical tools may reinforce attitude polarization and group stereotypes.",2023-11-03T19:45:09Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Huber, Lena Maria; Meyer, Thomas M.; Wagner, Markus",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0
Replication Data for: Divided We Unite: The Nature of Partyism and the Role of Coalition Partnership in Europe,doi:10.7910/DVN/YCDJNT,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YCDJNT,"Highlighting the strength of ‘partyism’ in many democracies, recent scholarship pays keen attention to increasing hostility and distrust among citizens across party lines, known as affective polarization. By combining a conjoint analysis with decision-making games such as dictator and trust games, we design a novel survey experiment to systematically estimate and compare the strength of the partisan divide relative to other social divides across 25 European democracies. This design also allows us to investigate how the two components of affective polarization, in-group favoritism and out-group derogation, are moderated by the way parties interact with each other. We first find dominance of the partisan divide compared to other social divides that constitute traditional cleavages such as social class and religion. Second, we show that affective polarization in Europe is not primarily driven by out-group animus. Finally, we demonstrate that coalition partnership significantly lessens affective polarization by reducing both in-group and out-group biases.",2023-03-30T15:53:32Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Hahm, Hyeonho; Hilpert, David; König, Thomas",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

We contend that while there is a general relative income effect on redistribution preferences, the preferences of the rich are highly dependent on the macro-level of inequality. The reason for this effect is not related to immediate tax and transfer considerations but to a negative externality of inequality: crime. We will show that the rich in more unequal regions in Western Europe are more supportive of redistribution than the rich in more equal regions because of their concern with crime. In making these distinctions between the poor and the rich, the arguments in this paper challenge some influential approaches to the politics of inequality.",2015-06-04T14:22:31Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Rueda, David; Stegmueller, Daniel",N/A

We use novel data on the degree of intra-party competition among the main German parties in all 299 electoral districts and on the ideological positions of candidates, measured using their Twitter statements in the run-up to the 2021 Bundestag election, to evaluate our expectations. In line with existing studies, we find that candidates who seek only their party’s nomination via lists deviate less from party leadership than candidates who seek nomination as a district candidate. In contrast to our expectations, candidates who seek their nomination in an electoral district do not deviate more ideologically from their party when they can expect to win the district seat on election day based on published polls during the candidate selection period.",2024-05-22T11:04:53Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Debus, Marc; Lattmann, Johannes; Wagner, Sarah",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Using original survey data from Germany, we find that respondents with Russian or Turkish ethnic background are less in favour of sanctions against Russia. This finding remains robust when considering respondents’ party preferences, education level, age, religious affiliation, and their region of residence, whether in Western or Eastern Germany. The results suggest that Russia’s war against Ukraine is likely to create tensions not only between individuals with different ideological orientations but can also result in conflicts between citizens with and without a Russian or Turkish migrant background or identity.",2025-02-17T13:27:18Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Debus, Marc; Diener, Julius; Himmelrath, Noam; Stecker, Christian",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Corroborating our expectations, the analysis of the candidate selection processes in the run-up to the 2013 Bundestag election shows that an increasing degree of ideological deviation from the party line—as expressed in parliamentary speeches—results in a worse position on the party list for opposition MPs, but does not affect the renomination chances of district candidates or of list candidates from the government camp.",2016-09-29T14:55:50Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Baumann, Markus; Debus, Marc; Klingelhöfer, Tristan",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Many countries have also experienced severely delayed government formation processes, with caretaker governments in office for extended periods of time. Are these delays related to the rise of radical parties? We argue that the rise of populist radical parties may prolong the bargaining process, due to that these parties are often treated as pariahs by other parties during election campaigns, which creates a complex bargaining situation after the election. We evaluate this claim by studying 121 government formation processes in the German States from 1990 until 2021, using original data which includes statements made by parties during election campaigns. The findings show that a higher share of seats allocated to parties from the radical right and radical left results in an increasing amount of days until a new government is voted into office. We also find that when a party that has been characterized as being ‘non-coalitionable’ during the election campaign ends up among the negotiating parties, the government formation process is severely delayed.

We argue that, first, the specific characteristics of the party system – that is, if there are further ethnic parties that compete for votes, in particular among the same ethnic group – matter for the policy profile of ethnic parties on immigration policy. Secondly, we expect that the ideological position of an ethnic party should matter for their immigration policy position: ethnic parties with a more right-wing ideological profile should adopt more negative positions on immigration, in particular if they face competition from another ethnic party. We use regression analysis and a manually coded sample of ethnic parties based on the Comparative Manifesto Project to test these assumptions. The empirical analysis provides support for our expectations: ethnic parties take more negative immigration positions if they compete with other parties among the same group of ethnic voters and the more the ethnic parties belong to the right-wing of the ideological spectrum.",2022-11-16T20:15:48Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Debus, Marc; Schulte, Felix",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

In lieu of existing causal explanations, we compile data on many factors contributing to candidate awareness and use a data-driven approach to identify variables that strongly predict voters' awareness of district candidates in the run-up of the German Federal Elections 2009, 2013 and 2017. We find factors that describe candidate-, voter-, and district characteristics politically to be important out-of-sample predictors in contrast to factors that describe them socio-demographically. Interestingly, we find that incumbency predicts candidate awareness, but it does not matter whether incumbents were elected nominally or via a party list.

Leveraging the appointment of the same mission chief to different countries throughout their career, we find that individual staffers influence the number, scope, and content of IMF conditions according to their personal ideological biases.

After a one-sided campaign focusing on law and order, the party’s vote share increased more than sixfold. By comparing the precinct with its direct surroundings, the study shows that the re-vote campaign had long-lasting effects on vote choice and broader security-sensitive behavior. Residents in the re-vote precinct installed more warning signs on their property to deter burglars. They were not more supportive of right-wing attitudes, but more likely to believe that election fraud reoccurred.

The Crowdsourced Replication Initiative Participant Survey,doi:10.7910/DVN/UUP8CX,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UUP8CX,"The Crowdsourced Replication Initiative (CRI) involved 204 researchers who volunteered to engage in a replication of a well-known study on immigration and social policy preferences. In this project, the participants were surveyed four times between August 20th, 2018 and January 20th, 2019. Survey questions with identifying features have been removed to protect participant anonymity and the data are available in the file cri_survey_long_public with labels or *_nolabs, without. The survey included both objective criteria, such as experience with methods and the substantive topic of the replication, and subjective criteria, such as the participants own beliefs about the hypothesis and immigration in general. In addition, they were asked questions about their time commitment, constraints they faced and some other feedback about the process of crowdsourcing. As of 2024, we provide data on the participants’ reviews of the other teams’ models. These review scores were initially not directly useable due to some problems with the 4th wave of the participant survey. The participants were given model descriptions that did not always match with the models they should have reflected. However, we have now used these paragraphs to match descriptions. We were able to match roughly 95% of all models. The new data file peer_model_dyad allows users to analyze data that are in participant-model dyad format. These data are linkable to both the participant survey here, and the CRI model specification and results data on Github (https://github.com/nbreznau/CRI). Because of matching and uneven numbers of models per team, there are some participants whose rankings apply to dozens of models and others only a few. The variable descriptions for these data are in the peer_model_dyad_codebook file. We also now provide dyadic data that matches each participant with each model specification produced by their team in df_dyad. These data contain all model specifications and the AME (Average Marginal Effect) produced by that model.",2024-11-11T15:23:56Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Breznau, Nate; Eike Mark Rinke; Alexander Wuttke",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Replication data for: Validating estimates of latent traits from textual data using human judgement as a benchmark,doi:10.7910/DVN/QWPDQJ,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QWPDQJ,"Automated and statistical methods for estimating latent political traits and classes from textual data hold great promise, since virtually every political act involves the production of text. Statistical models of natural language features, however, are heavily laden with unrealistic assumptions about the process that generates this data, including the stochastic process of text generation, the functional link between political variables and observed text, and the nature of the variables (and dimensions) on which observed text should be conditioned. While acknowledging statistical models of latent traits to be âwrongâ, political scientists nonetheless treat the treat their results as sufficiently valid to be useful. In this paper, we address the issue of substantive validity in the face of potential model failure, in the context of unsupervised scaling methods of latent traits. We critically examine one popular parametric measurement model of latent traits for text and then compare its results to systematic human judgments of the texts as a benchmark for validity.",2014-10-02T00:00:00Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Lowe, Will; Benoit, Kenneth",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Their capacity of doing so, however, critically depends on the strategic incentives they supply. My findings from a comparative analysis based on six waves of the European Election Study show that far right parties’ past attainment of legislative strength boosts the credibility of their policy appeal and broadens the scope of their protest appeal whereas their participation in government jeopardizes their capacity to mobilize on popular discontent.",2019-03-06T18:33:48Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Cohen, Denis",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

This article investigates how electoral participation can be substantially increased by holding multiple of these less important elections concurrently. Leading to a relative decrease in voting costs, concurrent elections theoretically have economies of scale to the individual voter and thus should see turnout levels larger than those obtained in any stand-alone election. Leveraging as-if-random variation of local election timing in Germany, we estimate the causal effect of concurrent mayoral elections on European Election turnout at around ten percentage points. Exploiting variation in treatment intensity, we show that the magnitude of the concurrency effect is contingent upon district size and the competitiveness of the local race.",2016-09-02T09:10:08Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Leininger, Arndt; Rudolph, Lukas; Zittlau, Steffen",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Answering this question is particularly difficult if reverse causality is looming. Many social scientists turn to panel data to address such questions of causal ordering.

Whereas the methodological literature has suggested various alternative solutions, these approaches face many criticisms, chief among them to be sensitive to the correct specification of temporal lags. Applied researchers are thus left with little guidance. Seeking to provide such guidance, we compare how different panel models perform under a range of different conditions. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that unlike conventional panel models, a cross-lagged panel model with fixed effects not only offers protection against bias arising from reverse causality under a wide range of conditions but also helps to circumvent the problem of misspecified temporal lags.",2019-06-11T13:48:08Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Leszczensky, Lars; Wolbring, Tobias",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Abstract: Citizens’ beliefs about uncertain events are fundamental variables in many areas of political science. While beliefs are often conceptualized in the form of distributions, obtaining reliable measures in terms of full prob- ability densities is a difficult task. In this letter, we ask if there is an effective way of eliciting beliefs as distributions in the context of online surveys. Relying on experimental evidence, we evaluate the performance of five different elicitation methods designed to capture citizens’ uncertain expectations. Our results suggest that an elicitation method originally proposed by Manski (2009) performs well. It measures average citizens’ subjective belief distributions reliably and is easily implemented in the context of regular (online) surveys. We expect that a wider use of this method will lead to considerable improvements in the study of citizens’ expectations and beliefs.",2020-08-28T20:04:49Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Leemann, Lucas; Traunmueller, Richard; Stoetzer, Lukas F.",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

"Risk Mitigation, Regimes Security, and Militias: Beyond Coup-proofing",doi:10.7910/DVN/N6M2OQ,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/N6M2OQ,"In Thailand, India, Libya, and elsewhere, governments arm the populace or call up volunteers in irregular armed groups despite the risks this entails. The widespread presence of these militias, outside the context of state failure, challenges the expectation that governments uniformly consolidate the tools of violence. Drawing on the logic of delegation, we resolve this puzzle by arguing that governments have multiple incentives to form armed groups with a recognized link to the state but outside of the regular security forces. Such groups offset coup risks as substitutes for unreliable regular forces. Similar to other public-private collaborations, they also complement the work of regular forces in providing efficiency and information gains. Finally, these groups distance the government from the controversial use of force. These traits suggest that militias are not simply a sign of failed states or a precursor to a national military, but an important component of security portfolios in many contexts. Using cross-national data (1981–2005), we find support for this mix of incentives. From the perspective of delegation, used to analyze organizational design, global accountability, and policy choices, the domestic and international incentives for governments to choose militias raise explicit governance and accountability issues for the international community.",2017-05-15T18:08:02Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Carey, Sabine C.; Colaresi, Michael P.; Mitchell, Neil J.",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Replication Data for: Why Underachievers Dominate Secret Police Organizations: Evidence from Autocratic Argentina,doi:10.7910/DVN/PGFOXW,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PGFOXW,"Autocrats depend on a capable secret police. Anecdotal evidence, however, often characterizes agents as surprisingly mediocre in skill and intellect. To explain this puzzle, this paper focuses on the career incentives underachieving individuals face in the regular security apparatus. Low-performing officials in hierarchical organizations have little chance of being promoted or filling lucrative positions. To salvage their careers, these officials are willing to undertake burdensome secret police work. Using data on all 4,287 officers who served in autocratic Argentina (1975-83), we study biographic differences between secret police agents and the entire recruitment pool. We find that low-achieving officers were stuck within the regime hierarchy, threatened with discharge, and thus more likely to join the secret police for future benefits. The study demonstrates how state bureaucracies breed mundane career concerns that produce willing enforcers and cement violent regimes. This has implications for the understanding of autocratic consolidation and democratic breakdown.",2019-08-23T12:49:42Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Scharpf, Adam; Gläßel, Christian",N/A

We evaluate our hypotheses in a cross-country study drawing on a novel data set covering all speeches given during one or two legislative terms in six European parliaments. We find that the electoral cycle matters for the distribution of speaking time: party leaders do restrict parliamentary speech-making to a smaller number of MPs at the end of the term.

A circular regression analysis using data on more than 25,000 government bills from 11 parliamentary democracies over 30 years supports this temporal perspective, showing that ministers initiate bills later in the term when their previous bills have experienced greater scrutiny.

We find that compared to other alternatives, private arbitration, known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), generates strong opposition to the trade agreement.

We draw on the case of Kremlin- sponsored communication on the issue of refugees in Germany to illustrate the mechanisms though which the discourse operates in target countries. We create a corpus of over a million news stories to identify the prevalence of illiberal discourse and its timing relative to Germany’s elections.

Replication Data for: Risk Aversion and the Gender Gap in the Vote for Populist Radical Right Parties,doi:10.7910/DVN/BTE2BK,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BTE2BK,"Previous research has established that men are more likely to vote for populist radical right parties (PRRPs) than women. This article shows how cross-national and temporal variations in PRRPs’ electoral success interact with individuals’ risk propensity to affect this gender gap. We hypothesize that gender differences in the electoral support of PRRPs stem from disparities in risk-taking. We conceptualize risk in terms of two components, social and electoral, and demonstrate that women are more risk-averse regarding both. Our analysis is based on public opinion data from 14 countries (2002–2016) combined with macro-level data on PRRPs’ past parliamentary fortunes. To distinguish between the social and the electoral component in risk-taking, we use the illustrative case study of Germany. Findings demonstrate that gender differences in risk-taking and, by implication, the differences between women’s and men’s responses to the electoral context, are key to understanding the voting gender gap.",2021-12-10T16:00:29Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Oshri, Odelia; Harsgor, Liran; Itzkovitch-Malka, Reut; Tuttnauer, Or",N/A

Replication Data for: The Politics of Seeking and Avoiding Discourse in Parliament,doi:10.7910/DVN/8K9NAN,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/8K9NAN,"When do politicians debate each other in parliament, and when do they prefer to avoid discourse? While existing research has shown MPs to unilaterally leverage the dialogical nature of legislative debates to their advantage, the circumstances facilitating actual discursive interaction have so far received less attention. We introduce a new framework to study the emergence of discourse in political debates. Applying this framework, we expect ideological differences and government-opposition dynamics to shape politicians’ choices about seeking or avoiding discourse. To test these hypotheses, we draw on an original dataset of all 14,595 attempted and successful interventions (Zwischenfragen) — extraordinary, voluntary discursive exchanges between speakers and MPs in the audience — in the German Bundestag (1990-2020), extracted using an annotation pipeline developed specifically for this study. We find that MPs separated by diverging preferences seek discourse with one another more often than their ideologically aligned counterparts. At the same time, these exact attempts do less frequently result in discursive interactions. When considering government-opposition dynamics in this process, we observe very similar patterns: Attempts to initiate discourse are particularly common among opposition MPs facing government speakers, and we find tentative evidence suggesting that government actors are most likely to avoid these invitations to discursive interaction. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of elite behaviour in public environments.",2025-02-12T15:41:49Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Koch, Elias; Küpfer, Andreas",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

While most existing work focuses on transforming labor markets as a source of anxiety, we advance the literature by studying changes in urban development and rent price appreciation. Our analysis examines the case of Germany, the country with the highest share of rental housing in the European Union. Combining individual-level geo-referenced panel data with a longitudinal data set on the cost of rental housing at the postcode level, we demonstrate that rising local rent levels increase support for radical right parties. The effect is especially pronounced among long-term residents, in particular in suburban and urban areas and among voters with lower household incomes. Our results suggest that urban development, not unlike labor market transformation, represents an important and so far neglected source of economic insecurity and social concern with important political implications.",2024-11-11T11:20:27Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Abou-Chadi, Tarik; Cohen, Denis; Kurer, Thomas",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

We argue that open lists undermine the electoral support of cohesive parties, to the benefit of internally divided parties.

A crossover design varies ballot type and exposure to candidate positions on immigration. We find that the internally divided CDU/CSU gains votes at the expense of the cohesive AfD when open lists are used and candidate positions are known. For individuals who are equally attracted to both parties, switching is most likely if their immigration preferences lie near the midpoint between the two parties. Overall, our analysis establishes conditions under which ballot structure can affect the electoral performance of parties in general, and that of the populist right in particular.",2021-12-12T13:08:28Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Bräuninger, Thomas; Däubler, Thomas; Huber, Robert; Rudolph, Lukas",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

It is a widespread view that mainstream party accommodation of radical right core issue positions would reduce the radical right's success. Empirical evidence for this claim, however, remains inconclusive. Using party level data as well as micro-level voter transitions between mainstream and radical right parties, we re-evaluate the effectiveness of accommodative strategies and also test whether they work contingent on specific conditions, e.g. the newness of radical right challengers or the existence of a cordon sanitaire. We do not find any evidence that accommodative strategies reduce radical right support. If anything, our results suggest that they lead to more voters defecting to the radical right.

This development is usually explained with reference to inherently political phenomena. We propose an alternative explanation, linking democratic backsliding to deep-reaching demographic change caused by mass emigration. We argue that because migrants tend to be more politically liberal, their departure, if quantitatively significant, can hurt liberal democracy. Empirically, we focus on Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Since 2004, the region has lost about 9 percent of its population due to migration to Western Europe. Drawing on data from 430,000 individuals and a panel analysis, we show that CEE migrants systematically hold more liberal values than non-migrants and that their exit went along with a deterioration of democracy in their home countries. Further analyses show that the mechanism we describe generalizes to various other world regions.

Ergebnisse eines Survey-Experiments,doi:10.7910/DVN/SM7LZK,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SM7LZK,"Women are underrepresented in the German parliament, especially in parties in and to the right of the political center. Gender quotas are frequently discussed as a remedy, but they infringe the liberties of parties, candidates, and voters. In contrast, open lists receive little attention, although they would avoid these constitutional issues. Therefore, we examine how many German voters - overall and by party - would choose female candidates from open lists. Theoretically, we expect that especially female voters, voters of left-leaning parties, and citizens for whom gender equality is a salient topic support female politicians. We also expect that voters tend to even out lists that are characterized by gender imbalance. Our research design utilizes an online survey-embedded experiment (N=2640) with a quota-representative sample of eligible voters. Participants chose between lists of the parties represented in parliament, with four fictitious candidates each. The share of women (25-75%) and the list type (closed vs open) were randomized. We show that both female and male voters consider the sex of the candidate, in line with the theoretical expectations. Our results suggest that female candidates would hardly be discriminated against, with some exceptions in specific subgroups (male voters of FDP, female voters of AfD). Taken together, this article shows that open lists enable citizens to cast preference votes in support of gender equality and that this opportunity is indeed seized. Across parties, voters level out unequal lists. Therefore, the electoral reform debate should pay more attention to the potential of open lists.",2022-06-02T14:34:05Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Rudolph, Lukas; Thomas Däubler; Jan Menzner",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

We draw attention to the hitherto neglected phenomenon ‘temporary disenfranchisement,’ which, for instance, occurs regularly in states that extended the franchise to underage citizens in some but not all elections. If an election with voting age 16 is closely followed by an election with voting age 18, underage voters eligible for the former will have no right to vote in the latter. Using original panel data on young citizens in Germany and a differences-in-differences design, we find that temporary disenfranchisement results in a decrease in external efficacy, which remains even after regaining eligibility. Our findings highlight an important side effect of selective voting rights extensions and bear insights relevant to other cases of temporary disenfranchisement due to residential mobility, citizenship or felony disenfranchisement.",2022-05-10T16:00:00Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Leininger, Arndt; Sohnius, Marie-Lou; Faas, Thorsten; Rossteutscher, Sigrid; Schäfer, Armin",http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0

Inspired by the Arab Spring, a large literature suggests that militaries confronted with civil resistance tend to side with protesters and oust their government. In the historically most coup-prone environment of insurgencies, however, alliances between the military and protesters are implausible because soldiers suspect insurgents behind social dissent. Disentangling different types of resistance, this article analyzes whether and how strikes, demonstrations, riots, and guerrilla attacks affect the military's disposition and ability to stage a coup during counterinsurgencies. We argue that only strikes trigger coup attempts. Soldiers interpret strikes as manifestations of a strengthening subversive enemy that threatens their victory over insurgents, while economic elites support a coup in the hope that the military will terminate costly walkouts. This interest alignment fosters military takeovers. We provide case-study evidence from Cold War Argentina and Venezuela to show our suggested mechanism at work. Demonstrating the scope of our argument, we quantitatively analyze coup attempts in counterinsurgency worldwide (1950-2005). Results show that strikes increase wartime coup risk, whereas demonstrations, riots, and guerrilla attacks do not.

Purpose: The development of a self-calibration algorithm for arbitrary CBCT trajectories that does not need initial positions. Methods: Projections are simulated in a spherical grid around the center of rotation. Through using feature detection and matching, an acquired projection is compared to each simulated image in this grid. The position with the most matched features was used as a starting point for a ﬁne calibration with a state-of-the-art algorithm. Evaluation: This approach is compared with the calibration of nearly correct starting positions when using FORCASTER and CMA-ES minimization with a normalized gradient information (NGI) objective function. The comparison metrics were the normalized root mean squared error, structural similarity index, and the dice coefﬁcient, which were evaluated on the segmentation of a metal object. Results: The parameter estimation for a regular Cone-Beam CT with a 496 projection took 1:26 h with the following metric values: NRMSE = 0.0669; SSIM = 0.992; NGI = 0.75; and Dice = 0.96. FORCASTER with parameter estimation took 3:28 h with the following metrics: NRMSE = 0.0190; SSIM = 0.999; NGI = 0.92; and Dice = 0.99. CMA-ES with parameter estimation took 5:39 h with the following metrics: NRMSE = 0.0037; SSIM = 1.0; NGI = 0.98; and Dice = 1.0. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm can determine the parameters of the projection orientations for arbitrary trajectories with enough accuracy to reconstruct a 3D volume with low errors.",2024-01-19T01:00:03Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Tönnes, Christian; Zöllner, Frank",N/A
Risk and incidence of endocrine immune related adverse effects under checkpoint inhibitor mono or combination therapy in solid tumors: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [data],doi:10.11588/DATA/AWIFGR,https://doi.org/10.11588/DATA/AWIFGR,"Supplemental Materials Abstract Context Few meta-analyses regarding the incidence of endocrine immune related adverse effects (eirAEs) have been published and many trials were published thereafter. Objective To assess the risk and incidence of eirAEs of any grade and grade 3-5 by immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) mono or combination-therapy in solid tumors current literature was updated in this comprehensive meta-analysis. Methods An electronic search using PubMed/Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library was performed. Randomized controlled studies (RCT) assessing eirAEs under ICI-mono or ICI-combination therapy were selected. Stata software version 17 was used for statistical analyses and risk of bias was evaluated by using Review Manager version 5.3. Results 69 RCTs with 80 independent reports, involving 42,886 patients were included in the study. Meta-analysis revealed the following pooled estimates for the risk ratio and the incidence, respectively: for any grade hypothyroidism 7.81 (95% CI, 5.68-10.74, p< 0.0001) and 7.64% (95% CI, 6.23-9.17, p< 0.0001); significantly increased also for hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis/hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency; and for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 1.52 (95% CI, 1.07-2.18, p= 0.02), and 0.087% (95% CI, 0.019-0.189, p= 0.0006), respectively. Meta-regression showed that combination of ICIs (nivolumab plus ipilimumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab, respectively) is an independent risk factor for any grade hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, and that ICI agent is an independent factor of risk for adrenal insufficiency, but that cancer type is not an independent risk factor for eirAEs. Conclusion We showed that risk, independent from cancer type, and incidence of eAEs are substantially increased under ICI therapy. Combination of ICIs is increasing the risk for eirAEs, in particular for hypophysitis/hypopituitarism.",2024-01-19T01:00:04Z,Harvard Dataverse,"Vardarli, Irfan; Tan, Susanne; Brandenburg, Tim; Weidemann, Frank; Görges, Rainer; Herrmann, Ken; Führer, Dagmar",N/A

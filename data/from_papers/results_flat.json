Within selected schools, two classes were randomly selected, and all students in those classes were asked to participate. The study utilized data from waves 1 and 3 of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (CILS4EU) and the fifth wave of its German extension (CILS4EU-DE).",

Findings suggest that the mindset paradigm can be expanded to include implicit theories about belonging experiences. The study also highlights the need for a more nuanced consideration of emotional and cognitive components when examining the mechanisms of change in implicit theories and belonging experiences. Participants were in a preparation phase for exams between the second and third measurement points, which was associated with increased stress.",

The experiment assessed response rates and sample representativeness within the GIP (General Population Internet Panel) recruitment process.

The study involved three recruitment rounds (2012, 2014, and 2018), with the 2012 and 2014 rounds using interviewer-mediated face-to-face interviews. Response rates were measured using online panel registration rates (RRreg).",

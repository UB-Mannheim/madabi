10.5281/zenodo.11234583,RUEG Corpus,2024-04-30,"The Research Unit Emerging Grammars (RUEG) investigates the linguistic systems and linguistic resources of bilingual speakers from families with an immigrant history, &ldquo;heritage speakers&rdquo;, in both of their languages across different language pairs, registers, and age groups. We investigate speakers of Russian, Turkish, and Greek as heritage languages in Germany and the U.S., in addition to German as a heritage language in the U.S., as well as monolingual controls for majority and heritage languages. We study noncanonical phenomena as indicators of new grammatical options in bilingual systems. All projects contribute to<br>three &ldquo;Joint Ventures&rdquo; targeting (1) the development of new dialects vs. incomplete acquisition or erosion (&ldquo;Language Change Hypothesis&rdquo;), (2) the relevance of internal vs. external grammatical interfaces (&ldquo;Interface Hypothesis&rdquo;), and (3) the distinction of contact-induced change vs. language-internal developments and variation (&ldquo;Internal Dynamics Hypothesis&rdquo;). As a result of our collaborative research, we expect new insights into the special dynamics of language variation, language change and linguistic repertoires in contact situations and the modelling of noncanonical structures in the grammatical system, and new impulses for the investigation of heritage speakers and of speakers&rsquo; resources.

10.5281/zenodo.3946462,TaxGraph - A Knowledge Graph of Multi-National Companies and their Relationships,2020-07-15,"The taxation of multi-national companies is a complex field, since it is influenced by the legislation of several states. Laws in different states may have unforeseen interaction effects, which can be exploited by allowing multi-national companies to minimize and avoid taxes.  Thus, we created a knowledge graph of multi-national companies and their relationships. Many commonly known tax avoidance strategies can be formulated as subgraph queries to this graph, which allows for identifying companies using certain strategies. Moreover, we can identify anomalies in the graph which hint at potential tax avoidance strategies.","Lüdemann, Niklas, Shiba, Ageda, Thymianis, Nikolaos, Heist, Nicolas, Ludwig, Christopher, Paulheim, Heiko",dataset,cc-by-4.0,https://zenodo.org/records/3946462

10.5281/zenodo.6962676,Diversity-Driven Unit Test Generation (Data Set),2022-08-04,"The goal of automated unit test generation tools is to create a set of test cases for the software under test that achieve the highest possible coverage for the selected test quality criteria. The most&nbsp;effective approaches for achieving this goal at the present time use meta-heuristic optimization&nbsp;algorithms to search for new test cases using fitness functions defined on existing sets of test<br> cases and the system under test. Regardless of how their search algorithms are controlled, however, all existing approaches focus on the analysis of exactly one implementation, the software&nbsp;under test, to drive their search processes, which is a limitation on the information they have&nbsp;available. In this paper we investigate whether the practical effectiveness of white box unit test&nbsp;generation tools can be increased by giving them access to multiple, diverse implementations&nbsp;of the functionality under test harvested from widely available Open Source software repositories. After presenting a basic implementation of such an approach, DivGen (Diversity-driven&nbsp;Generation), on top of the leading test generation tool for Java (EvoSuite), we assess the performance of DivGen compared to EvoSuite when applied in its traditional, mono-implementation&nbsp;oriented mode (MonoGen). The results show that while DivGen outperforms MonoGen in 33%&nbsp;of the sampled classes for mutation coverage (+16% higher on average), MonoGen outperforms<br> DivGen in 12.4% of the classes for branch coverage (+10% higher average).","Kessel, Marcus, Atkinson, Colin",dataset,cc-by-4.0,https://zenodo.org/records/6962676

The evaluation is then assessed in terms of how well the embedding approach performs on the task at hand, but it is hardly evaluated (and often not even deeply understood) what information the embedding approaches are <em>actually</em> learning to represent.  To fill this gap, we present the DLCC (Description Logic Class Constructors) benchmark, a resource to analyze embedding approaches in terms of which kinds of classes they can represent. Two gold standards are presented, one based on the real world knowledge graph DBpedia, and one synthetic gold standard.","Portisch, Jan, Paulheim, Heiko",dataset,cc-by-4.0,https://zenodo.org/records/6509715

We &nbsp;present a method for (1) inducing sense-aware semantic classes using distributional semantics and (2) using these induced semantic classes for filtering noisy hypernymy relations. Denoising of hypernyms is performed by labeling each semantic class with its hypernyms. On one hand, this allows us to filter out wrong extractions using the global structure of the distributionally similar senses. On the other hand, we infer missing hypernyms via label propagation to cluster terms. We conduct a large-scale crowdsourcing study showing that processing of automatically extracted hypernyms using our approach improves the quality of the hypernymy extraction both in terms of precision and recall. Furthermore, we show the utility of our method in the domain taxonomy induction task, achieving the state-of-the-art results on a benchmarking dataset.  This particular page contains datasets related to the paper. Namely the input induced word senses, a database of hypernyms, and the output clusters of senses labeled with hypernyms -- the distributional semantic classes. The semantic classes are of two granularities, as described in the paper (coarse and fine grained).&nbsp;","Alexander Panchenko, Dmitry Ustalov, Stefano Faralli, Simone P.

Currently, the archive builds on a stock of more than 3000 political documents from 20 European countries. The aim of the repository is to provide political texts in order to facilitate scholarly research in different areas of comparative politics such as party competition, coalition politics, legislative decision-making or electoral behavior.  National electoral manifestos have been collected in the course of the REPCONG project (&quot;Representation in Europe: Policy Congruence between Citizens and Elites&quot;), and the archive includes party manifestos for regional elections in several European democracies. Because the process of European integration resulted in a strengthening of regions in EU member states and in countries that want to join the European Union, the relevance of the regional level for political decision-making has increased during the last decades. Therefore, also the policy profiles of regional parties are required to get a full picture of democratic responsiveness in European states across all levels of the political system. The collection of regional manifestos was supported by the COHESIFY project (www.cohesify.eu), funded under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The aim of COHESIFY is to study whether the European Structural and Investment Funds affect people&rsquo;s support for and identification with the European project.  The archive is freely accessible (after a simple registration) and meant to foster rigorous research in these areas by enabling scholars to produce valid and reliable findings from empirical studies of textual data rather than unnecessarily struggling to obtain and process texts.","Bräuninger, Thomas, Debus, Marc, Benoit, Kenneth, Bernauer, Julian, Polidoc.net Team",dataset,cc-by-4.0,https://zenodo.org/records/1067701
10.5061/dryad.j3tx95x8x,Stratified Reward Structures and Competition in Markets for Creative Production,2019-12-12,"Stratified reward structures have emerged as a universal feature of modern society, but their implications on the producers and consumers of creative work are not fully understood. We conducted an online experiment to test the effects of reward stratification in peer-reviewed creative production markets. We find that competition induced by stratification shapes the evolution of creative production, and that the quality of each tier in a stratified market is consistent with its position in the hierarchy. The top tier maintains high-quality standards by attracting many submissions and by filtering its output, operating as an effective sorting device for budget-constrained consumers. However, stratification generates higher levels of inequality among producers, leading to higher rates of market-exit for those lagging behind. We discuss the broad implications of reward stratification and artificial scarcity in hypercompetitive environments, contributing to the debate on cumulative advantage and the allocation of funding and recognition in science.","Balietti, Stefano, Riedl, Christoph",dataset,cc-zero,https://zenodo.org/records/5013517

The project is funded within the SOPRAN project by the BMBF as the German part of the SOLAS initiative.  The participating groups were J. Williams, MPI for Chemistry, Mainz (PTR-MS measurements of gas concentrations in air and water), A. Engel, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel (SML measurements), M. van Pinxteren, TROPOS (aerosol measurements), and B. J&auml;hne, U. Heidelberg (MIMS and FTIR gas exchange measurements, active and passive thermography, and all environmental parameters including wave slope imaging). External groups include O. Wurl, ICBM (CO2 gas exchange and SML measurements), B. Schneider, IOW (CO2 measurements), and foreign groups from England (J. Najera, U. Manchester) and France (B. D&#39;Anna, CNRS, lab IRCELYON). The latter two groups supported the aerosol measurements.&nbsp; The experiment took place in November 2014. On September 23, twenty tonnes of Atlantic seawater, sampled from the Northern Atlantic Ocean on board of the research vessel POSEIDON and reloaded to a road tanker at GEOMAR, arrived in Heidelberg and were filled into the storage tanks in the basement of the building, where the Aeolotron is located.",Campus TV,video,cc-by-4.0,https://zenodo.org/records/13919

Coming Soon! <br><strong>1. Notes on Data Construction</strong> This is version 3.3.0 of the patccat data (patent claim classification by algorithmic text analysis). Patent claims define an invention. A patent application is required to have one or more claims that distinctly claim the subject matter which the patent applicant regards as her invention or discovery. We construct a classifier of patent claims that identifies three distinct claim types: process claims, product claims, and product-by-process claims. For this classification, we combine information obtained from both the preamble and the body of a claim. The preamble is a general description of the invention (e.g., a method, an apparatus, or a device), whereas the body identifies steps and elements (specifying in detail the invention laid out in the preamble) that the applicant is claiming as the invention. The combination of the preamble type and the body type provides us with a more detailed and more accurate classification of claims than other approaches in the literature. This approach also accounts for unconventional drafting approaches. We eventually validate our classification using close to 10,000 manually classified claims. The data files contain the results of our classification. We provide claim-level information for each independent claim of U.S. utility patents granted between 1836 and 2020. We also provide patent-level information, i.e., the counts of different claim types for a given patent. For a detailed description of our classification approach, please take a look at the accompanying paper (Ganglmair, Robinson, and Seeligson 2022). <strong>2. Citation</strong> Please cite the following paper when using the data in your own work: Ganglmair, Bernhard, W. Keith Robinson, and Michael Seeligson (2022): ""The Rise of Process Claims: Evidence from a Century of U.S. Patents,"" unpublished manuscript available at <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4069994"">https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4069994</a>. In the paper, we document the use of process claims in the U.S. over the last century, using the patccat data. We show an increase in the annual share of process claims of about 25 percentage points (from below 10% in 1920). This rise in process intensity of patents is not limited to a few patent classes, but we observe it across a broad spectrum of technologies. Process intensity varies by applicant type: companies file more process-intense patents than individuals, and U.S. applicants file more process-intense patents than foreign applicants. We further show that patents with higher process intensity are more valuable but are not necessarily cited more often. Last, process claims are on average shorter than product claims (with the gap narrowing since the 1970s). We would love to see how other researchers use the data and eventually learn from it.

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) fulfill these requirements.<br>However, DSL compilers reinvent the wheel over and over again as standard optimizations, code generators, and general infrastructure &amp; boilerplate code must be reimplemented for each DSL compiler. This paper presents MimIR, an extensible, higher-order intermediate representation.<br>At its core, MimIR is a pure type system and, hence, a form of a typed lambda calculus.<br>Developers can declare the signatures of new (domain-specific) operations, called <em>axioms</em>.<br>An axiom can be the declaration of a function, a type constructor, or any other entity with a possibly polymorphic, polytypic, and/or dependent type.<br>This way, developers can extend MimIR at any low or high level and bundle them in a <em>plugin</em>.<br>Plugins extend the compiler and take care of optimizing and lowering the plugins' axioms. We show the expressiveness and effectiveness of&nbsp;MimIR in three case studies:<br>Low-level plugins that operate at the same level of abstraction as LLVM, a regular-expression matching plugin, and plugins for linear algebra and automatic differentiation.<br>We show that in all three studies,&nbsp;MimIR produces code that has state-of-the-art performance.

It offers support for multiple visualization styles, such as layered-style, graph-style, and the newly added LeNet-like visualization. When provided with a sequential or custom PyTorch model, alongside the input shape and visualization specifications, VisualTorch automatically translates the model structure into an architectural diagram. The resulting diagram can be refined using various configurations, including style, color, opacity, size, and a legend. VisualTorch is particularly valuable for projects involving PyTorch-based neural networks. By facilitating the generation of graphics with a single function call, it streamlines the process of visualizing neural network architectures. This ensures that the produced results are suitable for publication with minimal additional modifications. Moreover, owing to its diverse customization options, VisualTorch empowers users to generate polished figures suitable for publication.","Hendria, Willy Fitra, Gavrikov, Paul",software,mit-license,https://zenodo.org/records/13852642

10.5281/zenodo.17708383,Beyond Edge Addition,2025-11-25,"<h1>Beyond Edge Addition: A Dataset for<br>Information Extraction Incorporating New<br>Instances, Types, and Relations</h1> Information extraction (IE) is the task of converting natural&nbsp;language text into structured triples comprising a subject, predicate, and&nbsp;object. Existing IE datasets often operate under the assumption that all&nbsp;entities (instances, properties, and classes) are already defined within a&nbsp;knowledge graph (KG), focusing solely on discovering the relationships&nbsp;between them. However, this assumption does not align with real-world&nbsp;scenarios, where many entities and relationships may be missing in the&nbsp;KG. Additionally, most current datasets do not provide a snapshot of the&nbsp;accompanying knowledge graph, leading to inconsistencies in evaluation,<br>as different systems may rely on different KG versions with varying degrees of completeness and labelling support. Such inconsistencies undermine fair benchmarking and reproducibility. In this paper, we introduce&nbsp;a novel information extraction dataset specifically designed to better&nbsp;reflect realistic KG incompleteness. Our dataset includes 20% missing&nbsp;classes and instances, along with 5% missing relations, requiring systems&nbsp;to not only add new links (edges) but also propose new instances, classes,<br>and relations. To ensure reproducibility and prevent leakage from pre-trained language models, we provide a heavily modified version of Wikidata where background knowledge cannot be exploited to trivially infer triples. This resource supports a more robust and comparable evaluation&nbsp;of IE systems in settings closer to real-world applications. We further&nbsp;present a strong baseline that employs large language models for extraction and disambiguation tasks, as well as encoder-based retrieval, to<br>integrate the background knowledge graph. It operates in several iterations, initially identifying a first set of triples, then progressively refining&nbsp;them by referencing the KG and generating new entities if necessary. &nbsp; <h1>Dataset Description</h1> There are two gzipped files uploaded. The first one contains the knowledge graph and the second one the actual dataset with the text and corresponding triples that should be extracted. The files are password protected such that the dataset is not easily included in future LLM training. The password can be found in the corresponding Github repository.","Hertling, Sven, Möller, Cedric, Mihindukulasooriya, Nandana, Usbeck, Ricardo",dataset,mit-license,https://zenodo.org/records/17708383

10.5281/zenodo.7422629,Post-hypnotic suggestion improves confidence and speed of memory access with long-lasting effects,2022-07-18,"The attempt to improve memory has a long tradition. Previous studies do not provide clear evidence concerning the longevity of memory-improving effects which is crucial for clinical applications. In our study, we use the post-hypnotic suggestion of easy remembering to establish long-lasting effects, as post-hypnotic suggestions can be activated with a cue after the hypnotic state. We tested 24 highly suggestible participants in an online study. Participants learned word lists and recalled them later in a recognition memory task where both learned and new words were presented and participants rated their recognition confidence. At the beginning of the study, participants were hypnotized and the post-hypnotic suggestion to remember easily was associated with a cue that participants used during the recognition memory task in the easy-remembering condition. In a control condition, the same participants used a neutral cue. One week later, participants repeated both conditions with new word lists, relying on the same post-hypnotic suggestion they received the week before.  Participants were significantly faster and more confident in their recognition ratings in the easy-remembering condition compared to the control condition, and this effect persisted over one week. Crucially, the increased speed and confidence in the easy-remembering condition did not affect memory accuracy; numerically, participants were even slightly better at discriminating old from new words in the easy-remembering condition. These findings demonstrate that post-hypnotic suggestions of easy remembering improve recognition confidence and speed with long-lasting effects, which makes it a promising intervention for patients experiencing subjective memory impairments.

However, endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage [EUS-BD] was associated with better clinical success and a lower rate of adverse events (AE) in recent comparative studies, although further improvements in the PTBD technique, such as primary stent implantation as a one-step procedure, percutaneous ultrasound-guided bile duct puncture and left-sided bile duct access, were not considered. The aim of this study is to compare both procedures carried out as intended one-step procedures with primary metal stent insertion.  <strong>Methods</strong>  The PUMa trial is an ongoing European non-randomized, controlled, parallel group, non-inferiority multicentre trial. Fourteen study centres perform only one of the two procedures with regard to the best local experience. PTBD is performed as a one-step procedure with primary metal stent insertion after percutaneous ultrasound-guided bile duct access. EUS-BD is performed as a one-step procedure using the EUS-guided trans-gastric or trans-duodenal access route for trans-gastric trans-hepatic (EUS-HGS), trans-duodenal (EUS-CDS) or antegrade trans-papillary (EUS-AGS) metal stent insertion. The main target values are the technical and clinical success rates, AEs within 30 days and overall disease-specific survival within 6 months. The calculated total number of cases is 212 patients.  <strong>Discussion:</strong>  The PUMa trial investigates whether PTBD is not inferior to EUS-BD in terms of technical and clinical success if primary metal stent insertion is performed as a one-step procedure in both procedures. Differences are expected in the quantity and variety of AEs, number of re-interventions and length of hospital stay.  <strong>Trial Registration</strong>: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03546049 (date of registration 22.05.2018)","Daniel Schmitz, Carlos Tortosa Valiente",dataset,cc-by-4.0,https://zenodo.org/records/4395092

10.5061/dryad.02v6wwq50,Stress induced TDP-43 mobility loss independent of stress granules,2023-05-03,"TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is closely related to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and translocates to stress granules (SGs). The role of SGs as aggregation-promoting ""bioreactors"" for TDP-43, however, is still under debate. We analyzed TDP-43 mobility and localization under different stress and recovery conditions using live cell single-molecule tracking and super-resolution microscopy. Besides reduced mobility within SGs, a stress induced decrease of TDP-43 mobility in the cytoplasm and the nucleus was observed. Stress removal led to a recovery of TDP-43 mobility, which strongly depended on the stress duration. 'Stimulated-emission depletion microscopy' (STED) and 'tracking and localization microscopy' (TALM) revealed not only TDP-43 substructures within stress granules but also numerous patches of slow TDP-43 species throughout the cytoplasm. The data provide new insights into the aggregation of TDP-43 in living cells and provide evidence suggesting that TDP-43 oligomerization takes place in the cytoplasm separate from SGs.","Streit, Lisa, Kuhn, Timo, Vomhof, Thomas, Bopp, Verena, Ludolph, Albert C., Weishaupt, Jochen H., Gebhardt, J.
